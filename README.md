# PayLater - EMI Payments Powered by PYUSD

PayLater is a decentralized Web3 payment platform that enables users to pay bills instantly or split payments into Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) using PYUSD stablecoin. The platform leverages liquidity pools, smart contracts, and wallet verification to provide global, transparent, and trustless EMI functionality.

## Overview

Traditional EMI systems are often limited by geographical boundaries, require extensive credit checks, and involve multiple intermediaries. PayLater addresses these limitations by providing a blockchain-based solution that offers immediate vendor payments while allowing users flexible repayment options.

## Key Features

### Streamlined Payment Options
- **Instant Payment**: Direct PYUSD transfer for immediate settlement
- **EMI Payment**: Split payments into manageable installments with automatic scheduling

### Liquidity Pool Integration
- Vendors receive full payment immediately from the liquidity pool
- Users repay over time through scheduled PYUSD installments
- Pool automatically rebalances as repayments are processed

### Wallet-Based Verification
- Mandatory wallet connection for EMI eligibility
- Built-in verification system to assess user qualifications
- Prevents system abuse through blockchain-based identity management

### Minimal Interface Design
- Clean, distraction-free checkout experience
- Intuitive EMI flow: Connect Wallet → Verify Eligibility → Confirm EMI → Complete Transaction

### Global Accessibility
- Primary operations conducted in PYUSD stablecoin
- Extensible architecture supports multi-stablecoin repayments with automatic conversion
